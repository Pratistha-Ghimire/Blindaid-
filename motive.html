		<h1>ESSENCE OF THIS PROJECT</h1>
			<p>Through mutual connection, we had the privilege of communicating with senior members of the Blind Youth Association Nepal(BYAN), an organization established by the Blind and Partially Sighted(BPS) Youth of Nepal with the vision of "BPS people of Nepal enjoying a dignified life in an inclusive society". Their work and dedication are truly inspirational. <br>

To support this wonderful group of people and to understand their work, visit: <a href="https://www.byanepal.org/">http://www.byanepal.org/</a><br>

But as we talked about the different objectives, plans and vision of Blind Youth Association Nepal, we understood that there is a huge problem associated with examinations for BPS students. According to Mr. Kaladhar Bhandari, the president of BYAN, a huge proportion of blind and partially sighted students in many regions of Nepal are unable to take their exams on time due to lack of assistance. The way examination works for visually impaired people is that they take the help of someone whose qualification is less than theirs to write the answer that they provide in the examination hall. But, many blind and partially sighted people donâ€™t get such helping hands on time. <br>

So, we came up with this project to connect helping hands with BPS students.</p>
